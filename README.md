Weather app which shows current weather in three cities: Dublin, London and New York.

There's quite a few shortcuts here as this project was only few hours long.

To run it:

    npm install

and then:

    npm start
    
Webpack dev server will start and app is running on localhost:5000

There might be some libraries which are in package.json but not used in this app.
I re-used my private base project.

Tested with node:

    v10.10.0
